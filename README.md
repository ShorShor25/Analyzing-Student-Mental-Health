# Analyzing-Student-Mental-Health
In this project, I find the correlation between students attending college and mental health. 

There was a lot of cleaning to do with the data, as it had many mistakes and inconsitencies, such as changing columns to its correct type, getting rid of insufficient data, and rename columns.

The strongest correlation comes from depression and martial status. If given more data, there would be a strong enough proof to show that there is a correlation between mental health and college.
